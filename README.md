# Problem Statement
+ Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money they‚Äôve spent,¬†and which menu items are their favorite.
+ Having this deeper connection with his customers will help him¬†deliver a better and more¬†personalized experience for his loyal customers.
+ He plans on using these insights to help him¬†decide whether he should expand the existing customer loyalty program¬†‚Äî additionally he needs help to generate some basic datasets so his team can easily inspect the data without needing to use SQL.

### Bonus Questions:
The following questions are related creating basic data tables that Danny and his team can use to quickly derive insights without needing to join the underlying tables using SQL. 

**1. Recreate the following table output using the available data:**

**2. Danny also requires further information about the ranking of customer products, but he purposely does not need the ranking for non-member purchases so he expects null ranking values for the records when customers are not yet part of the loyalty program.**
